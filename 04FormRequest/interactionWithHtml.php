<?php
// PHP and HTML interaction explained:
// When a user submits data through an HTML form, PHP handles the interaction by receiving the data, processing it, 
// and optionally responding to the user or performing server-side operations.
// In simple terms, this interaction involves collecting user input, sending it to the server, and receiving a response.

// This interaction is handled through requests in PHP.
// There are two main request methods for forms: GET and POST.

// GET request:
// - Data is visible in the URL.
// - Less secure, as sensitive information is exposed.
// - Commonly used to retrieve data from the server, such as in search queries.

// POST request:
// - Data is not visible in the URL.
// - More secure, as it keeps the data hidden from the user.
// - Often used for sending sensitive information or performing actions like creating or updating records on the server.
